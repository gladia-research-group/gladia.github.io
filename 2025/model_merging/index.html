I was a total disaster. But let me ask you one Estimathon-style question I just made up:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>‚ÄúHow many models were there on HuggingFace one year ago?‚Äù</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Take a moment to think before scrolling.

If, like me, you lean toward the latter in many practical cases, this blogpost is for you.

Informally, it‚Äôs any technique that, given two or more models (the endpoints) and produces a new one that preserves their capabilities. Typically, we want the merging process to be data-free, and the resulting model to have:</p> <ol> <li>The same number of parameters as the endpoints.</li> <li>No extra runtime overhead.</li> </ol> <p>These requirements are not always enforced. Depending on the use case, it might make sense to relax one of them ‚Äî for example, allowing <a href="#routing-and-moerging">extra overhead for routing</a> or using a small dataset to find <a href="#llms-and-evolutionary-merging">better merging coefficients</a>.</p> <p>Okay, but <em>what</em> models are we merging, and <em>why</em>? It‚Äôs helpful to think in terms of two broad categories. The subdivision is not strict, but it makes the landscape easier to navigate:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Merging models trained from scratch on the same task</strong> ‚Äî covering linear mode connectivity, neuron permutation symmetries, and permutation matching.</li> <li> <strong>Merging models finetuned from the same base model on different tasks</strong> ‚Äî including task vectors, structure-aware merging methods, and evolutionary merging of LLMs.</li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="merging-models-trained-from-scratch-on-the-same-task">Merging models trained from scratch on the same task</h2> <p>The setup is simple: we start with two models initialized differently, $\theta^A_{\text{init}}$ and $\theta^B_{\text{init}}$. We train both on the same task $t$, then merge them into a new model $\theta_t^{A,B}$. Since the task index doesn‚Äôt add much information in this context, we drop it.</p> <h3 id="mode-connectivity">Mode connectivity</h3> <p>It all began with <strong>mode connectivity</strong>.</p> <p>People once thought that parameters corresponding to different minima (modes) were <strong>isolated</strong> in the loss landscape, each mode living in its own valley (<strong>basin</strong>). This was bad news: if true, you couldn‚Äôt move between minima without incurring a sharp loss increase. But can these modes actually be connected in weight space via a low-loss (or high-accuracy) path?</p> <aside> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/blog/assets/img/blog/loss_landscape_plot-480.webp 480w,/blog/assets/img/blog/loss_landscape_plot-800.webp 800w,/blog/assets/img/blog/loss_landscape_plot-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/blog/assets/img/blog/loss_landscape_plot.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p> Two modes in their basins. </p> </aside> <p>Turns out the answer is <strong>yes</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Yes, and this allows us to interpolate between them to obtain cheap ensembles <d-cite key="Garipov2018-pz"></d-cite>.</li> <li>Yes, and in fact a large number of modes lie on a shared low-loss manifold <d-cite key="Draxler2018-vr"></d-cite>.</li> <li>Yes, and if the two modes share an initial training phase, the connecting path may even be linear <d-cite key="linear-mode-connectivity"></d-cite>.</li> </ul> <p>When the connecting path is linear, we usually assume the two modes to live in the same basin. This is kind of a big deal in model merging. Why? Well, because if the two modes can‚Äôt be connected linearly (i.e., linear interpolations between the modes result in a high loss), then we can‚Äôt average the models. Or, at least, can‚Äôt do it this simply. But how can we check if two modes are linearly connected, and to what degree? We will need to compute the loss barrier between the two.</p> \[\underbrace{\max_{\lambda \in [0,1]} \mathcal{L}\!\left((1-\lambda)\theta_A + \lambda \theta_B\right)}_{\text{highest loss along the path}} - \underbrace{\tfrac{1}{2}\Big(\mathcal{L}(\theta_A) + \mathcal{L}(\theta_B)\Big)}_{\text{average loss at endpoints}}\] <p>Here, the first term measures the highest loss encountered along the linear interpolation between the two modes, while the second one is the average loss at the endpoints. If the two modes lie in the same basin, the interpolated loss remains low and the barrier is close to zero. A high loss barrier instead suggests the presence of a peak or saddle point separating the two modes, indicating they belong to different regions of the loss landscape.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/blog/assets/img/blog/loss_barrier-480.webp 480w,/blog/assets/img/blog/loss_barrier-800.webp 800w,/blog/assets/img/blog/loss_barrier-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/blog/assets/img/blog/loss_barrier.png" class="mx-auto img-fluid rounded d-block" width="100%" height="auto" style=" max-width: 400px; " data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>Now that we know how to measure for closeness in the basin sense, we can move on to one of the key insights in model merging.</p> <hr> <h3 id="neuron-permutation-symmetries">Neuron permutation symmetries</h3> <p>Consider a generic linear layer $z_{\ell+1} = \sigma(W_{\ell} z_{\ell})$, removing biases for simplicity. Now, what happens if we shuffle the rows of $W_{\ell}$? That‚Äôs equivalent to multiplying on the left by a permutation $P$, giving $W_\ell‚Äô = P W_\ell$. The new output is</p> <aside> <p> Biases just need to be permuted along with the corresponding rows. </p> </aside> \[z'_{\ell+1} = \sigma(W_{\ell}' z_{\ell}) = \sigma(P W_{\ell} z_{\ell}) = P \sigma(W_{\ell} z_{\ell}) = P z_{\ell+1}.\] <p>Here, we‚Äôve pulled $P$ outside $\sigma$, possible because nonlinearities act elementwise and commute with permutations.<d-footnote>Intuitively: whether you first shuffle a sequence and then apply an elementwise nonlinearity, or apply the nonlinearity first and then shuffle, the result is the same.</d-footnote></p> <p>So far, the two networks (with $W_{\ell}$ vs $W‚Äô_{\ell}$) aren‚Äôt the same; their outputs differ by a permutation. But let‚Äôs also permute the <strong>columns</strong> of the <em>next</em> layer by $P^\top$. Since permutation matrices are orthogonal ($P^{-1} = P^\top$), the output of the next layer becomes:</p> \[z'_{\ell+2} = \sigma(W_{\ell+1}' z'_{\ell+1}) = \sigma(W_{\ell+1} P^\top P z_{\ell+1}) = \sigma(W_{\ell+1} z_{\ell+1}) = z_{\ell+2}.\] <p>No tricks, the math checks out. The outputs are <strong>identical</strong>.</p> <p>So, are these two networks the same? Internally, no, their weights differ (potentially a lot). But functionally, yes: they compute the exact same mapping.</p> <p>This shows that <strong>neuron permutations create families of functionally equivalent networks.</strong> And since different random seeds lead to different permutations, many distinct-looking weight configurations are actually the <em>same function</em>.</p> <p>This led to the conjecture: once you account for permutations, all modes collapse into a single shared basin <d-cite key="Entezari2021-me"></d-cite>. If this was the case, then we should in principle be able to find, for each layer of model $A$, a permutation of its neurons that maps them to the neurons of the corresponding layer in model $B$, practically teleporting $A$ into $B$‚Äôs basin. There, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">torch.mean(A, B)</code> is all you need!</p> <hr> <h3 id="neuron-matching">Neuron matching</h3> <p>We wrapped up the previous section looking for a magical way to align the neurons of two models. One possible objective could be the following</p> \[\arg\max_{\{P_\ell \in \mathbb{P}\}} \sum_{\ell=1}^{L} \left\langle W_\ell^A, \, P_\ell W_\ell^B P_{\ell-1}^{\top} \right\rangle\] <p>where</p> \[\langle A, B \rangle = \mathrm{tr}(A^\top B) = \sum_{i=1}^m \langle A_{i,:}, B_{i,:} \rangle,\] <p>so at layer $\ell$ we are basically looking for the permutation $P_{\ell}$ that best aligns the rows (neurons) of the two matrices in a dot product sense. $P_{\ell}$ is then also applied, after transposition, to the subsequent layer to maintain functional equivalence.</p> <aside> <p>Remember we are searching in the space of functionally equivalent networks.</p> </aside> <p>Like all good things in life, this problem is NP-Hard <d-cite key="git-rebasin"></d-cite>. The Git Re-Basin way, at this point, is to do a layer-wise approximation of the problem, in which the previous and subsequent permutations are held fixed, making each problem a simple Linear Assignment Problem (LAP).<d-footnote>Such a problem allows efficient off-the-shelf algorithms like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hungarian algorithm</a>.</d-footnote> Find a (somewhat simplified) version of the algorithm below.</p> <d-code block="" language="python"> <pre><code class="language-python">

</code></pre> </d-code> <p>Surprisingly, while Git Re-Basin (2022) is probably the most popular matching algorithm, a precursor (and also, a general case) of this algorithm by S.P. Singh and M. Jaggi was already around in 2019! <d-cite key="singh2020model"></d-cite> There, permutations are replaced by soft maps. These generalize permutations, since a soft map is just a doubly stochastic matrix. For instance a permutation matrix between two sets of $3$ objects would look like</p> \[\textbf{Permutation matrix } P = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix},\] <p>so each row/column has exactly one 1 (hard assignment), while a soft map may look like</p> \[\textbf{Soft map } S = \begin{bmatrix} 0.7 &amp; 0.3 &amp; 0.0 \\ 0.2 &amp; 0.5 &amp; 0.3 \\ 0.1 &amp; 0.2 &amp; 0.7 \end{bmatrix}\] <p>so rows/columns sum to 1, entries in $[0,1]$ (fractional assignment). Soft maps are the bread and butter of optimal transport.</p> <hr> <h3 id="entering-cycle-consistency">Entering cycle-consistency</h3> <p>Now entering my own work: I‚Äôll try to keep it fair and high level, so I don‚Äôt monopolize the overview. I can do this. The question here is: what happens if we want to match and merge more than 2 models? The easiest solution would be to choose one reference model, find pairwise maps to it, and then aggregate everything in this one. Couple of problems: when optimizing for each pair, the optimization is not aware of the other models. This means that the maps do not compose gracefully: if one maps from a model A to B, then to C and back to A, the end result would be way different than the starting point. In other words, the maps <strong>lack cycle-consistency</strong>. The other (main) problem is that the reference model is an arbitrary choice. And we know, arbitrariness is never good as it opens the way to variance in the results: depending on a (often random) choice might change the results by double digits. Let‚Äôs try something else! In $C^2M^3$ <d-cite key="cycle-consistent"></d-cite> we start from the <a href="#neuron-matching">standard weight matching equation</a> and consider all the possible pairs of models</p> \[\arg\max_{\{P_i^{pq} \in \mathbb{P}\}} \sum_{\substack{(p,q)}} \;\; \sum_{i=1}^{L} \left\langle W_i^p,\; P_i^{pq} W_i^q \left(P_{i-1}^{pq}\right)^{\top} \right\rangle\] <p>We factorize each permutation $P^{BA}$ (mapping $A$ to $B$) as the composition of two permutations: one mapping $A$ to a universe space, and one mapping from the universe back to $B$. Since each time you have to pass through the universe, you end-up with a series of permutations that cancel each other out, eventually composing to the identity and guaranteeing cycle-consistency.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/blog/assets/img/blog/pairwise-vs-cyclecons-480.webp 480w,/blog/assets/img/blog/pairwise-vs-cyclecons-800.webp 800w,/blog/assets/img/blog/pairwise-vs-cyclecons-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/blog/assets/img/blog/pairwise-vs-cyclecons.png" class="mx-auto img-fluid rounded d-block" width="100%" height="auto" style=" max-width: 500px; " data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>The optimization problem we obtain is similar, just a tiny bit uglier due to the factorizations.

This time we start from a common pretrained model $\theta_{\text{pt}}$, which is finetuned separately on different tasks $t_1, t_2$ (say, MNIST and CIFAR-100) to obtain $\theta_{t_1}$ and $\theta_{t_2}$. Our goal is to combine them into a single model $\theta_{t_1,t_2}$ that:</p> <aside>Notation note: I sometimes use $\theta_{\text{pt}}$ or $\theta_{\text{base}}$ to mean the same thing: the pretrained foundation model before finetuning.</aside> <ul> <li>Has the same number of parameters as the base.</li> <li>Can do both tasks at once.</li> </ul> <p>As before, we want this merging process to be data-free. Picture downloading two finetuned checkpoints from HuggingFace and fusing them into a single multi-task model without touching the original datasets.</p> <aside>You often don't even have access to finetuning datasets.</aside> <p>So how do we do it?</p> <h3 id="task-arithmetic">Task arithmetic</h3> <p>The story begins with a simple yet powerful observation: finetuning on a task looks like <em>adding a vector</em> in weight space. This is trivially true when you consider the difference between the finetuned model and its base. Let us denote the update induced by task $t$ as the <strong>task vector</strong></p> \[\tau_t = \theta_t - \theta_{\text{pt}}.\] <p>Then, finetuning is nothing more than</p> \[\theta_t = \theta_{\text{pt}} + \tau_t.\] <p>This way of writing things suggests an almost irresistible idea: if we want a model that can do both $t_1$ and $t_2$, why not just add their updates?</p> \[\theta_{t_1,t_2} = \theta_{\text{pt}} + \tau_{t_1} + \tau_{t_2}.\] <p>And there you have it: task arithmetic <d-cite key="task-vectors"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Of course, life isn‚Äôt quite that easy. Sometimes adding updates works beautifully, sometimes it leads to catastrophic interference, and sometimes you get a weird in-between model that can‚Äôt do either of the tasks. Still, the arithmetic view was an important first step: it made explicit that task updates behave <em>vectorially</em>, and therefore can be combined, compared, and even algebraically manipulated.</p> <p>So, in general, merging models through task arithmetic boils down to</p> \[\theta_{\text{MT}} = \theta_{\text{pt}} + \alpha \sum_{t \in T} \tau_t\] <p>where $\alpha$ is a scaling factor that is usually optimized on a validation set.</p> <h3 id="task-vectors-and-gradients">Task vectors and gradients</h3> <p>When I first heard about task arithmetic, I was puzzled: why should adding two random finetuning updates give anything meaningful? Let‚Äôs do a simple thought experiment.</p> <p>Suppose you finetune a pretrained model with vanilla gradient descent, no minibatches, and only a <em>single epoch</em>. In this case, the task vector is exactly the negative gradient of the loss at the base model:</p> \[\tau_t = - \eta \, \nabla \overline{\mathcal{L}}_t(\theta_{\text{pt}}),\] <p>where $\eta$ is the learning rate and $\overline{\mathcal{L}}_t$ denotes the average loss over task $t$.</p> <p>Now, if we add task vectors from multiple tasks, linearity of the gradient gives</p> \[\sum_{t \in T} \tau_t = \sum_{t \in T} \Big(- \eta \, \nabla \overline{\mathcal{L}}_t(\theta_{\text{pt}})\Big) = - \eta \, \nabla \Bigg(\sum_{t \in T} \overline{\mathcal{L}}_t\Bigg) = - \eta \, \nabla \overline{\mathcal{L}}_T(\theta_{\text{pt}}).\] <p>In other words, adding task vectors is (in this restricted setting) equivalent to taking a single <strong>multi-task gradient step</strong> from the pretrained model!</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/blog/assets/img/blog/task_vector_vs_gradient-480.webp 480w,/blog/assets/img/blog/task_vector_vs_gradient-800.webp 800w,/blog/assets/img/blog/task_vector_vs_gradient-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/blog/assets/img/blog/task_vector_vs_gradient.png" class="mx-auto img-fluid rounded d-block" width="100%" height="auto" style=" max-width: 500px; " data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>What about the scaling factor $\alpha$ we introduced earlier? In this view, $\alpha$ simply plays the role of the learning rate: tuning it adjusts how far you move along the combined gradient.</p> <p>Of course, this equivalence only holds in a very idealized setting (no minibatches, one pass, no curvature). With minibatches or multiple epochs, the connection weakens. Still, this perspective grounds task arithmetic in optimization, moving it away from magic vector algebra and toward something more principled. In <d-cite key="zhou2025taskvectors"></d-cite> we show to what degree this relation holds in practice, check it out!</p> <h3 id="structure-aware-merging-methods">Structure-aware merging methods</h3> <p>So up until now we have considered task vectors as flat vectors, so these $\theta$s live in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and so does $\tau$</p> \[\theta_{\text{MT}} = \theta_{\text{pt}} + \alpha \sum_{t \in T} \tau_t\] <p>But we all know that $\theta$ are not really flat vectors right? And neither should be $\tau$, since at some layers it may have a matrix or tensor structure.</p> <p>So we first consider these differences layer-wise, defining layer-wise task matrices instead of the global task vectors we‚Äôve discussed so far.</p> \[\theta_{\text{MT}}^{(l)} = \theta_{\text{pt}}^{(l)} + \alpha \sum_{t \in T} \Delta_t^{(l)}\] <p>And ask ourselves, can we actually leverage this structure? As it is often the case, we will start by studying the SVD of layers having a matrix structure.</p> \[\Delta = U \Sigma V^\top = \sum_{i=1}^{r} \sigma_i \, u_i v_i^\top\] <p>where $r$ is the rank of the matrix. The next question follows naturally: are $\Delta$s low-rank? i.e., we try to approximate $\Delta$ with</p> \[\tilde{\Delta} = \tilde{U} \tilde{\Sigma} \tilde{V}^\top = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sigma_i \, u_i v_i^\top \quad k \ll r.\] <p>Of course they are!</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/blog/assets/img/blog/deltas-low-rank.svg" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/blog/assets/img/blog/deltas-low-rank.svg" class="mx-auto img-fluid rounded d-block" width="100%" height="auto" style=" max-width: 500px; " data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>Ok cool then I guess we can just sum the low-rank approximations $\tilde{\Delta}$ and solve merging‚Ä¶ right?

Even if we could just restrict the set of selected tasks to $K$ instead of $N$ it would be something. Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking.. a router.

Optionally, we can threshold the resulting probabilities and choose a maximum $K$ defining the number of tasks that can be selected. We can now only merge these ones and use the resulting model for inference!</p> <p>Why should the right singular vectors of the $\Delta$s be a proper choice for task classification? It works very well in practice, and we show some cool experiments in the paper. I‚Äôll try to write a blogpost about it soon.</p> <h3 id="llms-and-evolutionary-merging">LLMs and Evolutionary Merging</h3> <p>Ok this all sounds cool, but what about LLMs? Well, it turns out that for these ones, task arithmetic already works quite well. There are some slightly more sophisticated methods which I will hopefully write about when I expand the blog, but for the moment let‚Äôs just say that they don‚Äôt usually result in double-digit improvements.</p> <p>Things change, however, if we drop the data-free constraint. In this case, results can be significantly better. One notable example is a recent paper from Sakana AI, proposing to use evolutionary algorithms to search for the best combination coefficients <d-cite key="akiba2025evolutionary"> </d-cite>. The results are quite impressive: they manage to synthesize a new Japanese LLM with state-of-the-art math-solving skills by merging a Japanese Mistral-7B finetuning with some math-specific finetunings.<d-footnote>Clearly, state-of-the-art in answering math questions in Japanese; merging is cool but it doesn't create new knowledge out of thin air.</d-footnote></p> <p>Evolutionary algorithms are cool, but they are not particularly famous for their efficiency. Just think that the framework involves a loop like the following</p> <d-code block="" language="python"> <pre><code class="language-python">

for step in steps:
  for model in population:
    fitness = eval(model, dataset)

</code></pre> </d-code> <p>where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eval</code> is a function that evaluates each model (LLM with a gazillion parameters) on the dataset and returns a fitness score. Each call might take hours. Multiply those hours by the number of models in each population and the number of steps, and you get a pretty good idea of the total compute cost involved. Merging is a pretty democratic tool, with hundreds of thousands of models being merged and uploaded on HuggingFace by everyday users on consumer GPUs, or even without accelerated hardware. So we ask ourselves, can we preserve some of the end performance of evolutionary merging but still allow common users to use it? The answer, against all expectations by the reader, is yes. Enter MERGE$^3$ <d-cite key="mencattini2025merge"></d-cite>. Intuitively, if we had a way to significantly shrink the evaluation dataset, we could make this process much more efficient. What if we had a way to estimate the accuracy of a model over a whole dataset given just a few of its samples? Say, 20? That‚Äôs precisely the goal of <em>Item Response Theory</em> (IRT). To do this, we use the logistic model proposed by tinyBenchmarks <d-cite key="polotinybenchmarks"></d-cite>. With this framework, we can approximate the model‚Äôs accuracy as the probability that the model is correct averaged over all the samples in the dataset</p> \[\operatorname{accuracy}(m) \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{P}(Y_{im} = 1 \, | \, {\color{OliveGreen}\gamma_m}, {\color{YellowOrange}\alpha_i}, {\color{Cyan}\beta_i}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{1 + \exp(- {\color{YellowOrange}\alpha_i}^\top {\color{OliveGreen}\gamma_m} + {\color{Cyan}\beta_i})}.\] <p>This probability depends upon three sets of parameters, $\alpha$s, $\beta$s and $\gamma$s. For a model $m$, ${\color{OliveGreen}\gamma_m}$ encodes its latent ability, while ${\color{YellowOrange}\alpha_i}$ selects what abilities are required for a particular sample. So the higher the alignment between ${\color{YellowOrange}\alpha}$ and ${\color{OliveGreen}\gamma}$, the higher the probability. The difficulty parameter ${\color{Cyan}\beta_i}$ then acts as a kind of per-sample threshold that shifts the center of the probability, i.e. the value that your alignment must have to reach a probability of 0.5. Without it, this would be just a standard logistic function, with probability 0.5 at logits equal to 0.</p> <p>Now, ${\color{YellowOrange}\alpha}$s and ${\color{Cyan}\beta}$s can be precomputed robustly over the dataset with different models, but ${\color{OliveGreen}\gamma}$ is model-specific. During the evolution we therefore have to estimate ${\color{OliveGreen}\gamma}$ only on the small subsample. Our key insight is that, being the model at hand a combination of the endpoints, also its abilities will be some combination of those of the endpoints. In particular, we assume this combination to be linear, and instead of fitting ${\color{OliveGreen}\gamma}$ directly, we fit its interpolation coefficients</p> \[{\color{OliveGreen}\gamma_{\tilde{m}}} = \sum_{j=1}^m \lambda_j \,{\color{OliveGreen}\gamma_{j}}\] <p>When we plug this new estimator into the evolution pipeline, we obtain results close to those obtained with the full dataset, but at a fraction of the computational cost. Indeed, the experiments that follow were run on an Nvidia 4090 in just a day!</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/blog/assets/img/blog/merge3_results.svg" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/blog/assets/img/blog/merge3_results.svg" class="mx-auto img-fluid rounded d-block" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <hr> <h2 id="what-comes-next">What comes next?</h2> <p>Looking at the big picture, the motivations for merging diverge a bit across domains. In computer vision, the main driver has been compression: taking multiple models trained on the same or related tasks and recycling their parameters into a more compact form. In language, by contrast, merging is mostly about compositionality: fusing different finetunings so the result can do a task that neither of the endpoints could do. Put simply: in vision, it‚Äôs fine if the merged model is just the sum of its parts; in language, we often hope for something greater than the sum.</p> <p>A natural, unsurprising goal for compression-oriented model merging is to reach the multi-task upper bound. Multi-task learning still suffers from task interference, but backpropagation at least helps mitigate it.</p> <p>Beyond that, some frontiers are still wide open. Heterogeneous merging (combining models with different architectures, widths, or parameter counts) remains largely unsolved. Most existing approaches assume architectural homogeneity, with the occasional exception of optimal-transport‚Äìbased methods that are less rigid. Cracking this problem would unlock unprecedented reuse.</p> <p>Finally, we‚Äôre still mostly blind when it comes to understanding why merging works. In some cases, merges succeed spectacularly; in others, they fail badly. Could tools from mechanistic interpretability come handy here?</p> <p>I‚Äôll try to continuously improve this blogpost, but for today that‚Äôs about as far as I can take you. Until next time, happy merging!</p> <h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2> <p>Of course, when I say my work, I really mean the collective effort of many brilliant collaborators<d-footnote>Listed in alphabetical order by last name.</d-footnote>: Daniele Baieri, Florian Bernard, Maria Sofia Bucarelli, Giuseppe Alessio D‚ÄôInverno, Marco Fumero, Antonio Andrea Gargiulo, Iacopo Masi, Tommaso Mencattini, Robert Adrian Minut, Emanuele Rodol√†, Andrea Santilli, Simone Scardapane, Fabrizio Silvestri, Daniele Solombrino, Luca Zhou, Alessandro Zirilli.</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/blog/assets/bibliography/2025-08-17-model_merging.bib"></d-bibliography> <d-article> <br> <br> <div id="giscus_thread"> <script>
