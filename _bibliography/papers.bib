 abstract = {Cross-lingual phenomena are quite common in informal contexts like social media, where users are likely to mix their native language with English or other languages. However, few studies have focused so far on analyzing cross-lingual interactions in voice-assistant data, which present peculiar features in terms of sentence length, named entities, and use of spoken language. Also, little attention has been posed to European countries, where English is frequently used as a second language. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical analysis of cross-lingual phenomena (code-mixing, linguistic borrowing, foreign named entities) in the interactions with a large-scale voice assistant in European countries. To do this, we first introduce a general, highly-scalable technique to generate synthetic mixed training data annotated with token-level language labels and we train two neural network models to predict them. We evaluate the models both on the synthetic dataset and on a real dataset of code-switched utterances, showing that the best performance is obtained by a character convolution based model. The results of the analysis highlight different behaviors between countries, having Italy with the highest ratio of cross-lingual utterances and Spain with a marked preference in keeping Spanish words. Our research, paired to the increase of the cross-lingual phenomena in time, motivates further research in developing multilingual Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models, which can naturally deal with cross-lingual interactions.},

 abstract = {Few-shot graph classification is a novel yet promising emerging research field that still lacks the soundness of well-established research domains. Existing works often consider different benchmarks and evaluation settings, hindering comparison and, therefore, scientific progress. In this work, we start by providing an extensive overview of the possible approaches to solving the task, comparing the current state-of-the-art and baselines via a unified evaluation framework. Our findings show that while graph-tailored approaches have a clear edge on some distributions, easily adapted few-shot learning methods generally perform better.  In fact, we show that it is sufficient to equip a simple metric learning baseline with a state-of-the-art graph embedder to obtain the best overall results. We then show that straightforward additions at the latent level lead to substantial improvements by introducing i) a task-conditioned embedding space ii) a MixUp-based data augmentation technique. Finally, we release a highly reusable codebase to foster research in the field, offering modular and extensible implementations of all the relevant techniques.},

 abstract = {Deep learning approaches have recently raised the bar in many fields, from Natural Language Processing to Computer Vision, by leveraging large amounts of data. However, they could fail when the retrieved information is not enough to fit the vast number of parameters, frequently resulting in overfitting and therefore in poor generalizability. Few-Shot Learning aims at designing models that can effectively operate in a scarce data regime, yielding learning strategies that only need few supervised examples to be trained. These procedures are of both practical and theoretical importance, as they are crucial for many real-life scenarios in which data is either costly or even impossible to retrieve. Moreover, they bridge the distance between current data-hungry models and human-like generalization capability. Computer vision offers various tasks that can be few-shot inherent, such as person re-identification. This survey, which to the best of our knowledge is the first tackling this problem, is focused on Few-Shot Object Detection, which has received far less attention compared to Few-Shot Classification due to the intrinsic challenge level. In this regard, this review presents an extensive description of the approaches that have been tested in the current literature, discussing their pros and cons, and classifying them according to a rigorous taxonomy.},

  abstract  = {Getting a good understanding of the user intent is vital for e-commerce applications to surface the right product to a given customer query. Query Understanding (QU) systems are essential for this purpose, and many e-commerce providers are working on complex solutions that need to be data efficient and able to capture early emerging market trends. Query Attribute Understanding (QAU) is a sub-component of QU that involves extracting named attributes from user queries and linking them to existing e-commerce entities such as brand, material, color, etc. While extracting named entities from text has been extensively explored in the literature, QAU requires specific attention due to the nature of the queries, which are often short, noisy, ambiguous, and constantly evolving. This paper makes three contributions to QAU. First, we propose a novel end-to-end approach that jointly solves Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Linking (NEL) and enables open-world reasoning for QAU. Second, we introduce a novel method for utilizing product graphs to enhance the representation of query entities. Finally, we present a new dataset constructed from public sources that can be used to evaluate the performance of future QAU systems.}

  abstract  = {Datasets used to train deep learning models in industrial settings often exhibit skewed distributions with some samples repeated a large number of times.This paper presents a simple yet effective solution to reduce the increased burden of repeated computation on redundant datasets.Our approach eliminates duplicates at the batch level, without altering the data distribution observed by the model, making it model-agnostic and easy to implement as a plug-and-play module. We also provide a mathematical expression to estimate the reduction in training time that our approach provides. Through empirical evidence, we show that our approach significantly reduces training times on various models across datasets with varying redundancy factors, without impacting their performance on the Named Entity Recognition task, both on publicly available datasets and in real industrial settings.In the latter, the approach speeds training by up to 87{\%}, and by 46{\%} on average, with a drop in model performance of 0.2{\%} relative at worst.We finally release a modular and reusable codebase to further advance research in this area.}
